        <h1><span>1. Introduction</span></h1>
        <p class="text"> <br>In this project, I’ll create a web interactive interface with React 
          for a bubble tea cafe. On the webpage, you can view and order various Heytea drinks. 
          This interface includes the following:
        </p>
        <div class="xuelie">
          <ol>
          <li> A list of 15 items for drinks displayed as components, including a picture  and various info </li>
          <li> Filtering functions that allow users to filter drinks by type (fruit tea, milk tea, juice, coffee) and temperature (cold, cold and hot)</li>
          <li> Sorting functions that allow users to sort drinks by type, price(low-high, high-low), calories, and popularity </li>
          <li> An aggregator that allows users to add and remove items from the Cart, and calculate the total price of items in the Cart</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p class="text2">

      <div class="stepone " id="one">

        <div>

        <p class="text2"><b>Heytea:</b> Heytea is a popular Chinese tea drink chain featuring cheezo fruit tea. The brand 
          is famous for its modern interior design, photogenic packaging, and innovative drinks and is well-known for its popularity
           on social media. </p>
        <p class="text2"><b>Goal:</b> This web interface allows users to view and navigate Heytea’s complicated menus with filtering 
          and sorting functions. Also, it allows users to order drinks by adding drinks to the Cart and removing items while seeing 
          the total price before check-out. 
        </p>
        <p class="text2"><b>Value: :</b> As bubble tea and tea shops become increasingly popular, there is also an increasing demand for ordering drinks online for pickup or delivery.
           This web interface is thus valuable in exploring various functionalities and optimizing user experiences of ordering drinks online.

        <h1 class="bg2"><span>3. Usability Principles and Prototyping </span> </h1>
        <br>
        <div>
        <p class="text2"><b>Learnability and memorability: </b> The app is very learnable and intuitive to use. All the interactive components are buttons, which tell the users 
          that they are clickable. Also, the buttons are clearly labeled. 
          Users can follow from left to right visually to add filter/sort criteria, view items, and view the cart and total price. The visual path and navigation are sequential,
           which corresponds to the steps users look at menus and order drinks. 
           on social media. </p>
        <p class="text2"><b>Efficiency: </b> The app is efficient as it keeps the nav bar, the drink items, and the cart on a single page. 
          The navigation bar and the cart are fixed on the side and the top, which allow users to scroll down to view the menu and add items
           to the cart while being able to use the filter and sort functions and view the cart anytime. 
        </p>
        <p class="text2"><b>
          Prototyping and design decision: </b>I re-use the design from a previous prototype I created for ordering a bakery.  It was proven more effective in the previous A/B testing, 
          so I kept the layout and design. The prototype is given below. I merely changed the navigation bar on the left to put the filtering and sorting buttons.  I also included more information 
          on the items while making  “ADD TO CART” and “REMOVE” buttons to add and remove items in the Cart.
